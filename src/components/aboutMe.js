        <h1>Hi!</h1>

        <p>My name is Andreas. I'm an aspiring Web Developer from Costa Rica, and speak both English and Spanish. Even though I have a bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering, my current job is not development related. In late 2016, I decided to change that and embarked into a journey of self-taught web development, and I've been coding in Javascript ever since.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include playing videogames (I've been hooked to 'Darkest Dungeon' lately), watching movies and TV with my fiancee (MCU ftw!), and food! And because I <em>really really</em> like food, I also run. I've ran 5 half marathons so far... we'll see if I can run a full marathon one day.</p>

        <p>I created this portfolio site trying to get some online presence. I sometimes write <a href="http://www.andreaslorozco.com/blog">quick tutorials</a>, and I'm also keeping track of my <em>"best"</em> <a href="http://www.andreaslorozco.com/portfolio">personal projects</a>. I have also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBAfloLGPcPvC-tSoH46yRA">uploaded some tutorials to YouTube</a> (in Spanish). With a full time job, it's quite hard to find time to blog, create videos, work on personal projects and have a social life but I'm trying my best to juggle everything around.</p>

        <p>If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find all my info on the '<a href="http://www.andreaslorozco.com/contact">CONTACT</a>' page (link at the top). If you're on desktop, I also have social media links on the sidebar.</p>
